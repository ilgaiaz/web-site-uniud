# Web site project
Developed in collaboration with two of my classmates, the project aims to show a website with features learned during the course of study.
For the project we have used: HTML, PHP, Java Script and other toolkits such as Bootstrap.

The site is available [here](https://web-application-uniud.herokuapp.com/projects.php).
